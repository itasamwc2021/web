        <h1>Our Theme</h1>
            
            <p>
            Our theme “Branch and Bound” stems from the titular computer science algorithm, which solves problems using branches of a “tree” that represent all candidate solutions. To arrive at the best outcome, the algorithm constantly pivots through the bounds of each branch and investigates all possible courses of action.
            </p><p><br>
We endeavor to take this algorithm and translate its essence into our conference through programming, community, and application. As we explore our options and branch out, we also arrive at the bounds of our skills, resources, and interests. But as long as we are bound to our community, which encourages and uplifts us as we learn and grow, we can adapt, redirect, and actualize our passions and dreams.</p>
<p><br>
We are confident this analogy will leave attendees with a better grasp of the possibilities available to them and the resources they have to achieve their goals successfully. “Branch & Bound” is meant to last a lifetime — our hope is that beyond this three-day conference, attendees will be imbued with a greater sense of purpose, identity, and community that lasts in the years to come.

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            
            <p>
            How do we interact with, discuss, and embrace our Taiwanese identity after we graduate college? When we enter the professional world, where do we go to find community? How can we hold conversations that encompass our relationship to Taiwanese heritage and the cultural nuance of being Taiwanese American in the Midwest?
            </p><p><br>
We seek to mitigate the lack of representation, connections, or exposure that often deter Taiwanese Americans from certain career choices by inviting speakers ranging from new graduates to community action advocates to industry professionals who can address the role of Taiwanese American identity in their careers and interests. Their stories will serve as a launching pad for our attendees to evaluate their individual branches and bounds, and attendees will have the chance to listen, share, and reflect with the support of their peers in intimate, small group discussions.</p>
<p><br>
In combining programming with a sense of greater community at the 2021 Midwest Conference, we aim to facilitate an environment that encourages and inspires each attendee to explore their options and pursue new opportunities, and ultimately equips them with the resources and support necessary to lead, interact, and give back to their communities, even after the conference has ended.
